<h2 style="color:#FF4500">The First Gaming PC</h2><img type="image" src="images/nim.jpg" alt="nim machine depiction" height="320px" width="80px" />
<p>One of the earliest known instances of an electronic game was at the Festival of Britain held in London in 1951 where a large room sized computer was on display as an attraction for  visitors to the festival. This large machine was used to play a game known as Nimrod named after the game NIM. 
<br>(designed by John Makepeace Bennett and built by engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams - Computer Company Ferranti)<br>
The aim of this game was to remove matches from individual stacks in turns. The winner would be the last person to remove a match from a pile.<br> 
The user's input was taken by buttons on a panel which indicated their choice by a light.<br> 
The machine would then make a choice and the calculation was represented by another set of lights. This could be slowed down to be explained.
The reason this machine was created to give Bennett and Williams an opportunity to showcase their programming and design skills. It came as a surprise that the audience was more interested in playing the game than knowing how it works. 
This could be seen as an early indicator of the potential for video games that lay ahead.
