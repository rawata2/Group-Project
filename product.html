						<h3>Basic Functionality</h3>
						<p>Books can be downloaded digitally onto Noteable.This saves students and workers from having to carry all their resources. Noteable can also act as a copy, allowing students/workers to type their work and save it as a document. Noteable also features a calculator app that allows users to make large calculations. Noteable is capable of running two applications simultaneously, by dividing the screen into two sections for both applications they can be used side by side. This feature is great if you like to take notes while reading, it saves from having to switch to the notes application.</p>
